Requirement:

Universal containers have a requirement for maintaining Accounts using a custom lightning web component that displays related contact records that can be placed on the Application home page with the below features. 

-> Display the Custom accordion with the Account Records with Fields(Account Name, Type, phone, Rating with Icon based on the value) on the main accordion header (Not in expanded section). Hint: look at SLDS Accordions
-> Onclick of the Account, the accordion will expand & display the list of contacts related to the Account in a tile view and the rest of the sections must collapse. Only one Account-contact section at a time. 
-> Search based on Account Name on top of the component. This is a live search. (Updates the accounts shown as you type along) 
-> Ability to add the contacts from the expanded contact tile section. The expanded accordion section must have a ‘New Contact’ button, on click of which the popup of a standard new contact must open with the Account field pre-populated.
